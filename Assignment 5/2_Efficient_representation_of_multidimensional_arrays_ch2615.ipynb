    "Kruskal decomposition is a form of Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) where a mild uniqueness condition is applied on CPD ensuring that any columns of factor matrices are linearly independent (factor matrices are full rank). When this mild condition is satisfied, then Kruskal form is unique for a tensor. CPD (Kruskal) considers the canonical (the minimal (rank-1) structure using minimum number of factors) and polyadic (the structure is formed by the outer product of N vectors) decomposition of a tensor by a linear combination of rank-1 tensors. This means that the core tensor of CPD contains non-zero elements along the main diagonal, thus ensuring that each factor 1 component of factor matrices are associated with one another and none of them is associated with any other set of components (factors). In other words, by decomposing order-N tensor $\\mathbf{X}$ into a sum of rank-1 tensors $\\mathbf{X}_{i} = \\mathbf{b}^{1}_{i} \\otimes \\dots \\mathbf{b}^{N}_{i}$, factor 1 components $\\mathbf{b}^{n}_{i}$ are only associated with each other and not with any other set of such components for $i \\neq j$. This effectively means that the dimension size in each mode of core tensor must be equal. \n",

    "not necessarily canonical, so tensor is not decomposed into rank-1 tensors but higher rank tensors. This means that factor matrices are not necessarily full-rank and any component from the different factor matrices can be associated with one another. Therefore, the TKD core tensor captures and models any mutual interaction between the vectors in different modes and it cannot be generally diagonalized. Since the core tensor is not necessarily diagonal as in CPD, the numbers of components in the different modes of core tensor can be different. As a result of this, TKD is not necessarily unique unless constraints are imposed on all factor matrices and/or the core tensor, but subspaces spanned by the factor matrices are unique. \n",

    "In summary, the CP decomposition can be considered as a special case of the Tucker decomposition, whereby the core tensor is diagonal, i.e. has only nonzero elements on the main diagonal."
